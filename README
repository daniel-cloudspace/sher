WHAT IS SHER?

    Sher (pronounced: "Share") is a Django app designed to allow you to upload
    your media and have it share it across your various
    social networking accounts.

CURRENT FEATURES:

    * Nothing. This is a skeleton of a project to come.

NOTES:

    This is by no means production-ready code. Do not actually use it in
    production unless you wish to be eaten by a grue.
